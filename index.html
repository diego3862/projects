            <b>Strategy…</b>is a concept quite cherished, probably even overused, in the business executive world at all levels, and paradoxically (or maybe as a consequence) is one of the worst defined and most confused across business practitioners. Many, as a result, end up (wrongly) dismissing it, even portraying it as the opposite to <i><b>Execution</b></i>.
            </br>
            </br>
            </br>
            At <b>AG Strategy & Partners</b> we think both are intrinsically united: Strategy is <b><i></i></b>“those key first 5 thinking minutes in the exam”</i></b>, Execution is the rest, so everything!
